# Script to generate Rust types from OpenAPI specification
# This is a placeholder - in production you would use tools like:
# - paperclip
# - utoipa
# - openapi-generator

echo "2. Generate Rust structs and traits"
echo "3. Output to src/generated/"

# For now, we'll manually implement the types based on the OpenAPI spec
